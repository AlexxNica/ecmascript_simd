# ecmascript_simd
===============

128-bit SIMD numeric type ECMAScript straw man proposal.

## Introduction

ECMAScript provides no programmer accessible access to the **Single Instruction
Multiple Data** (_SIMD_) instruction sets that are available in common CPU
architectures. In this proposal, the _SIMD_ data types and operations are
modeled for both NEON (ARMv7) and SSE (IA32/X64) instruction sets.
They should also be compatible with [AltiVec]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltiVec) but no consideration for
AltiVec has been made.
